## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of cloud computing services, including computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, analytics, and more, to help businesses scale and grow efficiently.

AWS enables businesses and developers to run applications and services in the cloud without needing to invest heavily in on-premises infrastructure. With a pay-as-you-go pricing model, AWS makes it easy to scale resources according to your needs.

## Key Features of AWS:
- **Compute:** AWS provides scalable compute resources with services like **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, allowing users to launch virtual machines in the cloud.
- **Storage:** AWS offers reliable storage solutions such as **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** for scalable object storage, and **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** for block-level storage.
- **Databases:** AWS supports a wide range of database services, including **RDS (Relational Database Service)**, **DynamoDB (NoSQL database)**, and **Redshift (Data Warehouse)**.
- **Networking:** AWS offers **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** for creating isolated networks, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for distributing traffic, and **Route 53** for domain name services.
- **Machine Learning:** Services like **SageMaker** help build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- **Security:** AWS provides built-in security tools such as **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**, **AWS Shield** for DDoS protection, and **KMS (Key Management Service)** for encryption.
- **Serverless Computing:** AWS offers serverless services like **Lambda** for running code without provisioning servers.

## AWS Core Services:

### 1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
EC2 allows you to create and manage virtual servers, also known as instances. You can choose the operating system, size, and resources needed for your instance, and pay for what you use.

#### Launching an EC2 Instance:
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**, such as an Ubuntu or Windows server.
4. Select the **instance type**, such as `t2.micro` for small, low-cost instances.
5. Configure your instance settings, including network and storage options.
6. Add storage and select **Security Groups** to allow SSH or RDP access.
7. Review and launch the instance.

### 2. **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
S3 is an object storage service used to store and retrieve data. Itâ€™s highly durable, with 99.999999999% durability over a year.

#### Creating an S3 Bucket:
1. Go to the **S3 Dashboard**.
2. Click **Create Bucket**.
3. Provide a unique name for your bucket and select the region.
4. Set permissions and configure advanced settings if necessary.
5. Click **Create**.

### 3. **RDS (Relational Database Service):**
RDS allows you to easily set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. Supported databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

#### Launching an RDS Instance:
1. Go to the **RDS Dashboard**.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. Select a database engine (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
4. Configure your database settings, including instance size and storage.
5. Set up your database security groups and IAM roles.
6. Launch your RDS instance.

### 4. **Lambda:**
AWS Lambda allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the compute time you consume.

#### Creating a Lambda Function:
1. Go to the **Lambda Dashboard**.
2. Click **Create Function**.
3. Choose **Author from Scratch** and configure the function.
4. Define the trigger (e.g., S3 event or CloudWatch event).
5. Upload the code or use the inline editor.
6. Set up permissions with IAM roles, and click **Create Function**.

### 5. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**
IAM enables you to control access to AWS resources by creating and managing users, groups, and permissions.

#### Creating a New User:
1. Go to the **IAM Dashboard**.
2. Click **Users** and then **Add User**.
3. Set up a username and select the type of access (e.g., Programmatic or AWS Management Console access).
4. Set permissions by attaching policies like `AdministratorAccess`.
5. Review and create the user.

## Best Practices for AWS:
- **Use IAM roles and policies:** Instead of using root credentials, create and assign IAM roles to control access and enforce the principle of least privilege.
- **Monitor usage with CloudWatch:** Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring resources, setting alarms, and automating actions based on metrics.
- **Implement Auto Scaling:** Set up Auto Scaling groups for EC2 instances to scale automatically based on traffic or usage.
- **Use S3 Lifecycle Policies:** Automate data retention by setting S3 lifecycle policies to archive or delete old data.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Use automated backups and enable multi-region replication for high availability and disaster recovery.

## AWS Pricing:
AWS operates on a **pay-as-you-go** model, which means you pay only for the services you use. Pricing can vary based on factors like instance size, storage volume, data transfer, and additional services. AWS also offers **Free Tier** options for getting started with limited usage at no cost.
